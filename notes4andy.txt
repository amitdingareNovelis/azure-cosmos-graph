# CosmosDB GraphDB Project - Six Degrees of Julia Roberts

## IMDb Data

I downloaded the raw data from here:

- http://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
- https://datasets.imdbws.com

## Wrangling

I filtered and wrangled the raw data with python to get a managable
set of data to load into the DB.  The algorithm is driven by this list
of actors.

    def actors_for_candidate_movies(self):
        actors = dict()
        actors['nm0000102'] = 'kevin_bacon'
        actors['nm0000113'] = 'sandra_bullock'
        actors['nm0000126'] = 'kevin_costner'
        actors['nm0000148'] = 'harrison_ford'
        actors['nm0000152'] = 'richard_gere'
        actors['nm0000158'] = 'tom_hanks'
        actors['nm0000206'] = 'keanu_reeves'
        actors['nm0000210'] = 'julia_roberts'
        actors['nm0000234'] = 'charlize_theron'
        actors['nm0177896'] = 'bradley_cooper'
        actors['nm1297015'] = 'emma_stone'
        actors['nm2225369'] = 'jennifer_lawrence'
        return actors

The filtering logic then extracts just the movies that these actors were
in, and the actors that were also in each movie.
